Each log represents a concrete maintenance action performed on an asset at a specific point in time.\nThe application is developed incrementally as a school project on the third semester at EK. Lyngby, where new backend technologies and architectural concepts are gradually introduced and integrated into the same system.\nCore concepts\r#\rAssets that require maintenance Maintenance logs representing performed work Users with different roles (e.g. technician, manager, admin) Historical data that should not be modified or deleted Initial scope\r#\rThe initial version of the system focuses on a simple domain model with assets and maintenance logs, exposing basic CRUD functionality through a REST API.\nAuthentication, authorization, validation, testing, and deployment concerns will be added progressively as the project evolves.\nGoal\r#\rThe goal of this project is to build a production-ready backend system that demonstrates clean structure, realistic business rules, and continuous technical progression.\nSo after that piece of business pitch, lets go into what actually happened this week:\nThe Project \u0026amp; Hibernate\r#\rSo this weeks focus was to get hibernate integrated into the project and understand how the different annotations works and what they do. I started with by defining what entities my project should have and how my structure should looks like going forward. I started by defining a quick class diagram in a plantUML diagram\nafter that i got to work on actually creating relations (or trying since i dont actually know if theses work yet), and creating a some DAO classes for MaintenanceLog and User. The final result after todays work looked like this:\nand finally a quick rundown of my current design decisions:\nMaintenance Log - Design Decisions\r#\r1. Immutability of Maintenance Logs\r#\rDecision: MaintenanceLog entries are never updated or deleted Implementation: MaintenanceLogDAO has NO update() or delete() methods Rationale: Data integrity and traceability (GDPR compliance, audit trail) Future consideration: Log corrections will reference previous entries (handled in service/GUI layer) 2. Soft Delete for Users\r#\rDecision: Users are deactivated, not deleted (active boolean field) Implementation: User.active field added No delete() method in UserDAO update() method used to set active = false Rationale: Preserve historical data — maintenance logs need to show who performed them, even after users leave 3. Entity Relationships\r#\rMaintenanceLog relationships:\r#\r@ManyToOne to Asset (owning side) @ManyToOne to Task (owning side) @ManyToOne to User (owning side) All relationships: LAZY loading, nullable = false Asset relationship:\r#\r@OneToMany to MaintenanceLog (non-owning side) mappedBy = \u0026quot;asset\u0026quot; LAZY loading No setter (only managed via MaintenanceLog creation) 4. No Helper Methods on Entities\r#\rDecision: No addLog() helper method in Asset Rationale: Stateless REST API — entities reloaded fresh each request, so in-memory bidirectional sync not needed Implementation: All relationships managed via builder pattern on owning side (MaintenanceLog) 5. DAO Layer Responsibilities\r#\rDAOs are \u0026ldquo;dumb persistence\u0026rdquo; — no business logic\r#\rResponsibilities:\nCRUD operations Database queries Return null for not-found (consistent with em.find()) Not responsible for:\nValidation (service layer) Business rules (service layer) HTTP concerns (controller layer) 6. Transaction Management\r#\rDecision: Transactions only on write operations Read operations (SELECT queries): NO transaction Write operations (INSERT, UPDATE): Transaction required 7. Query Strategy\r#\rPrimary key lookups: Use em.find() (simpler, cached) Other queries: Use JPQL with named parameters Consistency: Methods return null when not found (not exceptions) Exception: getByEmail() catches NoResultException and returns null 8. User Authentication Considerations\r#\rDecision: UserDAO.getByEmail() filters by active = true Rationale: Only active users can log in But: UserDAO.get(userId) returns all users (active or not) Rationale: Historical lookups need to show inactive users (who performed a log) 9. Field Protection\r#\rDecision: Manual @Setter annotations on individual fields Primary keys: NO setter (immutable after creation) Other fields: Setters allowed for updates Rationale: Prevents accidental ID modification 10. Email Uniqueness\r#\rDecision: Database-level constraint + service-layer validation Implementation: @Column(unique = true) on User.email Rationale: Defense in depth — database prevents duplicates, service layer provides better error messages Portfolio Site\r#\rFinally to end this \u0026ldquo;little\u0026rdquo; entry for the week, i think actually talking a little about this hugo/blowfish template thing is in its place. Is has been a fun little side thing to get up and running and i looks forward to tinkering with the different settings and find out how everything actually operates as i go further along. Im doubtful if i will use this for other things than a Dev Log atm. but maybe i should start my new life as a Bread Blogger aswell. I just think there is too much sourdough in the world already, and i think i get only a short runway on throwing up pictures of my normal yeast bread.\n","date":"6 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Portfolio/devlog/maintenancelog-firstweek/","section":"Devlogs","summary":"So first of all welcome to this first week post of the development of my little maintenance log, just for posterity lets start with what is in my readme for the project, since that actually breaks down what it its:\nMaintenance Log Backend\r#\rThis project is a backend API for managing maintenance history of assets such as machines, vehicles, or equipment.\n","title":"Maintenance Log - First Week","type":"devlog"},{"content":"","date":"6 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Portfolio/tags/maintenancelog/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"MaintenanceLog","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"6 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Portfolio/tags/project/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Project","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"6 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Portfolio/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Portfolio/tags/blog/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Blog","type":"tags"},{"content":"First Blog, alot of testing going on with this template\u0026hellip; nothing is set in stone for how it looks, but lets see where we end up when were done.\n","date":"5 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Portfolio/posts/0502-2026/","section":"Posts","summary":"First Blog, alot of testing going on with this template… nothing is set in stone for how it looks, but lets see where we end up when were done.\n","title":"First Blog","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"5 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Portfolio/tags/firstpost/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"FirstPost","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Portfolio/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"Her kommer der en About me sektion\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Portfolio/aboutme/","section":"Jesper Andersen - Blog \u0026 DevLog","summary":"Her kommer der en About me sektion\n","title":"About","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Portfolio/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Portfolio/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Portfolio/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
