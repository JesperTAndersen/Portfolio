If you’ve somehow found your way here: welcome!

My name is Jesper Andersen. At the time of writing this (2026), I’m in my early thirties and currently working on my AP degree in Computer Science at EK – Lyngby in Denmark.

Before this, I spent 14 years in construction working as a journeyman painter.

When I’m not busy being a student, I spend my time being a father (to two lovely daughters), a husband, a recreational bodybuilder, an enjoyer of video games, and an amateur Warhammer painter. I also own two cats: one loves me, and the other merely accepts my presence in the household.
